All right Detroit, I wanted the craziest night, I got the craziest night, the most random guy in the world: Ozzy! 

We were on our way to party hard in the hotel's bar, as one would, right. And as we enter, we started getting shooed and yelled at from what I can only describe as people who have had more plastic surgery than my wife. (Love you, darling) 

Unlike my wife however, they had terrible taste in music. What is up with kids these days? 

Anyhow. Ozzy was having none of it. The dude just told me he has a pretend-to-be-dead-potion-and-ruin-their-party plan.
